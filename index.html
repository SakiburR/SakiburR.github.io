      <h3>Sakibur Rahman</h3>
      <p> I joined City, University of London in September 2020, where I am studying towards a Computer Science BSc (Hons). Prior to this, I studied A-level Mathematics, Further Mathematics, and Geography at St Paul’s Way Trust Sixth form. Alongside my studies I have worked as a Sales Associate, GCSE Tutor, and am currently working part-time as a Customer Service Advisor at Argos.

I strongly believe that cultivating a healthy body and mind is essential to optimise performance in all areas of life. I take importance in keeping myself both mentally and physically fit, and to do this I do my best to work out in the gym and go to a boxing club.

I have a keen interest in being an active member of my community, this includes working with charities and helping the less fortunate. I voluntarily work with a charity called RDF (Rural Development Foundation), and in June 2019 climbed to the summit of Mount Ben Nevis with my team to raise money for maternity clinics in Bangladesh. I have also worked worked with another charity called Scope, who are the disability equality charity in England and Wales. Other than this, I have also done work experience at Ticketmaster International Head Office, back in 2017, where I worked alongside the staff in the IT department.

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Speedy Snake Game</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
	of the use of arrays, variables, classes, for loops, if statements, soundfiles, and randomness. I created a 2D Snake Game in which a 'snake'
	grows larger by eating 'food'. Every time the food is consumed by the snake, it grows larger, and the food respawns at a random location in the area. 
	As the snake consumes its food one-by-one, a 'Score' is added for every piece of food it consumes, and this is displayed in the upper left corner of the sketch.

    <h3>Naruto Energy Run - Game for IN1007 Java Coursework</h3>
    <p>
	This is my second programming project, where I made a Game using Java. My game is called Naruto Energy Run, and this game/project took roughly 2-3 months to make.

	The main objective of the game is for Naruto to collect his Chakra balls and reach the energy goal in order to advance to the next level. Once he gets the required energy, naruto can use the yellow portal to go to the next level.

	Along Naruto's Journey he faces multiple enemy's such as Madara, Sasuke, Kisame and Itachi. If naruto collides with the enemies he gets destroyed and loses the game. However, with Naruto's shuriken ability, he can launch shuriken at his enemies and destroy them with ease. Naruto is also faced with the red portal which sends him back to his spawnpoint.

	Whilst making the game I have faced many challenges and I have learnt alot. This includes problems I faced when making  the save and load feature, making a throwable shuriken, and lots more. Comparing my first programming project with this one, I can tell how the module IN1007 Programming in Java has helped improve my programming skills massively.

	Below I have attached the link for the code, and have made a very short video which briefly shows off my game.
