      <h3>Sakibur Rahman</h3>
      <p> I joined City, University of London in September 2020, where I am studying towards a Computer Science BSc (Hons). Prior to this, I studied A-level Mathematics, Further Mathematics, and Geography at St Paul’s Way Trust Sixth form. Alongside my studies I have worked as a Sales Associate, GCSE Tutor, and am currently working part-time as a Customer Service Advisor at Argos.

I strongly believe that cultivating a healthy body and mind is essential to optimise performance in all areas of life. I take importance in keeping myself both mentally and physically fit, and to do this I do my best to work out in the gym and go to a boxing club.

I have a keen interest in being an active member of my community, this includes working with charities and helping the less fortunate. I voluntarily work with a charity called RDF (Rural Development Foundation), and in June 2019 climbed to the summit of Mount Ben Nevis with my team to raise money for maternity clinics in Bangladesh. I have also worked worked with another charity called Scope, who are the disability equality charity in England and Wales. Other than this, I have also done work experience at Ticketmaster International Head Office, back in 2017, where I worked alongside the staff in the IT department.

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Speedy Snake Game</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
	of the use of arrays, variables, classes, for loops, if statements, soundfiles, and randomness. I created a 2D Snake Game in which a 'snake'
	grows larger by eating 'food'. Every time the food is consumed by the snake, it grows larger, and the food respawns at a random location in the area. 
	As the snake consumes its food one-by-one, a 'Score' is added for every piece of food it consumes, and this is displayed in the upper left corner of the sketch.
